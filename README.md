# LocalLibrary - March

## Introduction

After working since september 2024, until now, march 2025, I have been working on this Django project for seven months.
After my learning institution had decided to use MDN Web Docs' tutorial as a way to step into learning Django, I have 
studied the very basics of what a framework means, how different Django framework may be with all its uniqueness (models, 
views, PIP modules, etc.), and, most importantly, how to use it and code what you may think of in it.
This repository here serves as a way of posting online what I have done so far.

## How to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/LocalLibrary-March.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LocalLibrary-March
3.- Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate
    python3 manage.py collectstatic
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    python3 manage.py runserver

## About the Project

-Since it was used primarily in my learning institution, it sometimes switches from Spanish, English, and then back to Spanish.

-It is possible to create an account without accessing the /admin/ backend.

-OneToOne field relationships, PDFs, pictures, and videos stored, Django API RESTful, forms, and JSON.

-And most importantly, it is memory of what my progress has been these seven months.
